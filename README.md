# arduino-car-electrics-control
Arduino based solution to control lights, turn signals, wiper, horn, etc. of a Mercedes Sprinter  

This is a tiny part of a massive DIY mod of a Mercedes Sprinter for having it controlled by disabled people without the ability to use the normal controls for:
- turn signals
- flash light
- upper beam headlights
- hazard flasher
- wiper
- wiper speed
- fountain solution
- rear fog lamp

Technically there are some special placed pushbuttons for use with the back of the head and wrist of the right hand that activates [a bunch of relays](https://www.amazon.de/JBtek-8-Kanal-Relais-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B00KTELP3I).
